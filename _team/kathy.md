Choosing the right college is one of the most important decisions your family will make—and it can feel overwhelming. That’s where Kathy comes in. With more than 35 years of experience in higher education and admissions, she brings not only unmatched knowledge, but also deep compassion and care for every student she works with.
Kathy holds a doctorate from the George Washington University.  She has served as Dean of Admission at both the George Washington University and the University of San Francisco, giving her a unique understanding of what colleges on both coasts look for—and what students need to succeed.
But what truly sets her apart is her heart. Kathy takes the time to understand your child—their strengths, hopes, and dreams—and helps them discover schools where they’ll thrive not just as students, but as people. She believes that college fit is about more than rankings; it’s about finding a place where your child feels seen, supported, and inspired.
