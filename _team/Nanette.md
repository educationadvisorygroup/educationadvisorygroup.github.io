Nanette has nearly forty years of experience in admissions and college counseling. Her work
with students began at Washington University where she as the Director of Admissions for 13
years. During this time, Nanette read evaluated thousands of applications from the strongest
and most talented students in the world.

Working with students is a passion and led Nanette to become the Director of College
Counseling at one of the most respected independent secondary schools in the country. She
remained the Director of College Counseling for thirteen years and mentored students applying
and being admitted to every selective university in the United States. She loves seeing the
students and their thought processes as they apply to college and she clearly understands the
importance of starting early and creating a plan.

Nanette has the benefit of working with students and their families from both sides of the desk.
She understands the importance of students finding and pursuing their interest at an early age
and she has the experience of knowing what an impressive application includes.

Nanette has been invited to be a guest speaker at hundreds of high schools around the country
and enjoys helping students and families understand the complexities of college admission.

Working with students brings Nanette such joy! In addition to admissions and college
counseling, she was also an academic advisor for several years, helping students decide on the
courses that would be the best fit for them and where they could achieve success. Helping
young people think about their next steps is an absolute delight.
