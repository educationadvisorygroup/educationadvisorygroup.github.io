Beth brings a wealth of global teaching experience and expertise to the EDUCATION
ADVISORY GROUP team, with a career dedicated to empowering students to achieve their
academic and personal goals. At Middlebury, Beth worked with international students to elevate
their language proficiency to thrive at the graduate level. Her courses went beyond language
acquisition, introducing students to the formal and informal expectations of American higher
education, pedagogy, and second-language acquisition techniques.

A Middlebury graduate with a master’s in Applied Linguistics/ESL, Beth is a recognized expert
in communication and public speaking. She has developed and led interview training programs,
equipping students with the skills and confidence needed to excel in Admission officer
interviews.

Beth’s six years of teaching in China, Canada, Taiwan, and the United States have further
enriched her ability to connect with students from diverse cultural backgrounds. Passionate about
building strong relationships, she brings enthusiasm, energy, and a student-centered approach to
every interaction.

Beth specializes in helping students discover their interests and create impactful extracurricular
pathways, making her an exceptional fit for young learners in 9th and 10th grade. For juniors and
rising seniors, she draws on her extensive background in teaching writing to guide students
through brainstorming and refining compelling, authentic Personal Statements.

When Beth isn’t working with students, she’s likely tending her garden, experimenting in the
kitchen, or exploring the scenic hiking trails near her home in Germany.
